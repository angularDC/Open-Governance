## Proposed Topic

### Your Code Coverage Report is Lying to You
* Session Title:  Your Code Coverage Report is Lying to You
* Preferred Timeframe:February 13, 2019
* Event Type: 30-min talk + Q&A
* Summary:Code Coverage is a metric often used by clients (and contracts) to establish confidence in your automated test suite.  But did you know that your code coverage reports could be poorly misrepresenting the real state of your coverage?  Weâ€™ll examine how Jasmine, Karma and the Angular Testbed conspire to artificially inflate code coverage numbers, how that can negatively impact your project, and what steps can be taken to mitigate this problem.  These techniques will also cause a dramatic decrease in how long it takes to run tests, leading to faster deployments and development cycles!
